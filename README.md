The auction site project made for a project for college, during the execution of the project I mainly focused on learning the backend, that is, programming the user's communication with the server and dynamic data updates. The project itself is not fully functional because it lacks important features that would make the site usable in practice. i.e. online payments, expanded auction search engine, expanded user registration, etc.
